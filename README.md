Name- Jay Mehta (22B1281)

Here is the brief report of my learning in the SoC so far:

Week0:- 
I had joined the SoC almost at the end of Week0. Although I had received the lecture links of Prof. David Silver from a friend which I had watched over the week. 
From there I got a really good interest in RL and that's where I learnt the basics of RL.
After this we had to solve a theory task on contents of lec2. 
And we also had to simulate a simple MDP "CarMDP".

Week1:-
This week we had to learn various probability distributions and read the theory of Multi-Armed Bandits from the reference book by "Sutton and Barto".
We had a theory task on the topics of probability. We also had to learn about two Python libraries- "NumPy" and "MatPlotLib".
We learnt about the epsilon greedy algorithm for reinforcement learning and implemented it in a Multi-Armed Bandit problem.

Week2:-
This week was relatively relaxed compared to others since we only had to watch some video lectures of Prof David Silver.

Week3&4:-
This 2 weeks we had to write a RL program to show two different policies- Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference Learning. 
We had to make a RL program to solve the Taxi problem from OpenAI Gymnasium. 
I have attached the codes for both Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference Learning.
