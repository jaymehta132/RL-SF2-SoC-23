Name- Jay Mehta (22B1281)

Here is the brief report of my learning in the SoC so far:

Week0:- 
I had joined the SoC almost at the end of Week0. Although I had received the lecture links of Prof. David Silver from a friend which I had watched over the week. 
From there I got a really good interest in RL and that's where I learnt the basics of RL.
After this we had to solve a theory task on contents of lec2. 
And we also had to simulate a simple MDP "CarMDP".


Week1:-
This week we had to learn various probability distributions and read the theory of Multi-Armed Bandits from the reference book by "Sutton and Barto".
We had a theory task on the topics of probability. We also had to learn about two Python libraries- "NumPy" and "MatPlotLib".
We learnt about the epsilon greedy algorithm for reinforcement learning and implemented it in a Multi-Armed Bandit problem.
The week1 figure.pdf shows the performance of the policy with different values of epsilon in the epsilon-greedy policy.


Week2,3:-
This 2 weeks we had to write a RL program to show two different policies- Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference Learning. 
We had to choose any one out of four games to be solved. The games were Taxi, CartPole, MountainCar, LunarLander.
I wrote the program to solve the Taxi problem and the CartPole problem.
I have attached the codes for both Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference Learning for the Taxi problem. 
On running the two codes we find that the TD learning algorithm works way better for this problem compared to MC learning.
I have also attached the code for solving the CartPole problem using Q-learning/TD(0).


Week4,5,6:-
We had to watch some more video lecs of Prof David Silver and a Neural Networks playlist by 3Blue1Brown.

Week7&8:-
Final project weeks.

game.py is the code for a simple game involving probabilities.

carMDP.py is the code a simple MDP.

week1.py is the code for the Multi-Armed Bandits problem

taxi monte carlo.ipynb is the code for the Monte Carlo Learning algorithm for the Taxi problem.

taxi td(0).ipynb is the code for the Q-Learning/TD(0) Learning algorithm for the Taxi problem.

CartPole -Q learning.ipynb is the code for the Q-Learning/TD(0) Learning algorithm for the CartPole problem.
